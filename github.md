# github baics
We must link the github repository to our server repository (look [here](https://github.com/CompBio-Group/LINEs)).

You can add stuff at different moments and then push everything at the end.

Before pushing, you are asked a token to be generated.

We will just commit things, the admin will then push them.

To remove things we should use git rm.

This is the way to work on our repository. With shared repositories is different, because there can be version conflicts: so we should use branches.

Create new branch git co -b [the_name]
