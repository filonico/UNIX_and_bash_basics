# Bioinformatics basics for trainee students
This GitHub was originally intended to introduce trainee students of the **[EVO • COM group](https://sites.google.com/view/evo-com-unibo/home)** of the University of Bologna to the Bash environment. However, this GitHub is obviously freely available for use by anyone who may find it helpful.

Here you will find a friendly resource for accessing commonly used commands in early bioiformatics.

🪅 **Enjoy!**

## What's inside this repository?

Very few files, actually, but fairly packed. Commands and explanations are presented in markdown files and are divided into macro-topics. They are numbered in the order I tipically use for teaching students. A series of example files are also provided.

| Macro-topic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [**01 - Bash basics**](./01_bash_basics.md) | The very first introduction to bioinformatics. Look here for basic bash commands and operations. | 
| [**02 - Working with Conda**](./02_working_with_conda.md) | What's Conda and how to use it. |
| [**03 - Working with screen sessions**](./03_working_in_screen_sessions.md) | What's a screen session and how to use it. |
| [**04 - git and GitHub**](./04_git_and_github.md) | What's git and how to use it.
| [<code>Example files/</code>](./example_files/) | A directory containing several files used to test commands. |
| [<code>download_PDFs/</code>](./download_PDFs/) | A directory containing the PDF version of markdown files to be downloaded |
