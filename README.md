# Bioinformatics basics for trainee students
This GitHub is meant to introduce trainee students of the **[EVO • COM group](https://sites.google.com/view/evo-com-unibo/home)** of the University of Bologna to the Bash environmen,t and as a general reference to retrieve the most common commands used in early bioinformatics.

Clearly, feel free to take advantage of this GitHub even in the case you are not a student from the University of Bologna.

🪅 **Enjoy!**

## What will you find in this repository?

Very few files, actually (for the moment...). Commands and explanations are in markdown files and are divided into macro-topics. Markdown files are numbered in the order I usually teach them to students. A series of example files are also provided.

| Macro-topic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [**01 - Bash basics**](./01_bash_basics.md) | The very first introduction to bioinformatics. Look here for basic bash commands and operations. | 
| [**02 - Working with Conda**](./02_working_with_conda.md) | What's **Conda** and how to use it. |
| [**03 - Working with screen sessions**](./03_working_in_screen_sessions) | What's a **screen session** and how to use it. |
| [**04 - git and GitHub**](./04_git_and_github.md) | What's **git** and how to use it.
| [<code>example_files/</code>](./example_files/) | A directory containing several files used to test commands. |
