# Bash basics for trainee students
This repository is meant to introduce trainee students of the MoZoo Lab of the University of Bologna to the Bash environment and as a general reference to retrieve most common commands used in bioinformatics.

**Enjoy!**

## Unix, Linux and Bash: let's make things clear
When first approaching bioinformatics, biologists may tend to confuse and use indiscriminately the words "Unix", "Linux" and "Bash". However, each of them refers to *different concepts*.

Basically, **UNIX** is a registered trademark of [The Open Group](https://www.opengroup.org/unix-systems) that refers to all the operating systems (OSs) in compliance with certain standards. In particular, all of the UNIX systems *derive directly* from the original Unix system developed at the beginning of the 70s at AT&T Bell Labs: therefore, it's better to say that **UNIX is a family of OSs**. Conversely, all the OSs that are *inspired by* but are *not fully compliant* with UNIX are called **UNIX-like** systems.

Two popular examples of UNIX systems are [Solaris](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/) and [AIX](https://www.ibm.com/products/aix), while two popular examples of UNIX-like systems are [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) and MacOS X (the most recent Apple systems). Two examples of non-UNIX systems are Windows and AppleDOS/MacOS (the very first Apple's systems).

So now you should have also understood what is Linux (or better, GNU/Linux). **GNU/Linux** is (another) OS of the **UNIX-like family** and is the result of the fusion of the Linux and the GNU projects (we will not discuss here the reasons behind this fusion). GNU/Linux comes nowadays with many distributions ("distros" in short), like [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu-it.org/) (the one you are probably going to use), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/it/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.it.html) and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
